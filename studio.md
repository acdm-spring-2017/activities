# About the Course's Studio Component (In progress. More here soon.)

## Summary

On any given day, studio time is a free working period in which you may choose to prioritize your work however you would like. On some days, there will be a list of students who are set to do a one-on-one conference with me. On your assigned day, you should bring work in progress to show me what you are trying to do and to ask me about anything that might require some assistance. If you are stuck and aren't set to meet with me very soon, you can also come to my office hours or make an after class appointment. Other than that, I only ask that you use the time to do something useful and document it accordingly (initially with the skills assignment log and then with a similar log for the final portfolio assignment). If you feel like you can't think of anything to do, here are some suggestions:

1. Get ahead on tutorials or review old tutorials.
2. Brainstorm lightning talk ideas.
3. Looks for cool data visualizations or infographics online and see if you know how to replicate one of them. If you can't find any cool ones, send me a topic and I'll help you look.
4. Work on one of your viz projects.
5. Catch up on course readings.
6. Work on gathering, wrangling, or creating your dataset for project 2.
7. try to do something you perceive to be very, very hard, with nio expectation that you will succeed. You might surprise yourself.
8. Make a branch of your project and try to "creatively break" it in some way. See what you can learn.
Write a long email letting me know that you are frustrated and that you need more guidance to feel engaged or challenged. (Wait until the next day to send it in case you are in a bad mood and say some things you later decide to word more carefully.)

## Specific Studio Days on the Calendar

I will set this once the memberships are set. See below. I plan to focus on one team per session.

## Professor Conferencing

This area will list names and dates for individual conferences. I will set these in class on Tuesday, January 17. See https://github.com/acdm-spring-2017/activities/blob/master/memberships.md

## Etiquette

- Unless otherwise noted, studio time is for individual work, not teams. But I do plan to add some more partner type activities to the studio calendar.

- Studio time is not a good time or place to discuss grades. That should be done in during my office hours or by appointment in my office.

- Music or tutorials with audio are fine as long as you use headphones.

- Please avoid texting, Facebook, etc.

- If you are disruptive, I reserve the right to ask you to leave class.

## FAQs

If you have questions about studio time, let me know. I will add anything that generalizes (and its response) here.
