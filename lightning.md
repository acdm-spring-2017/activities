# Lightning Talks

## Description

Lightning talks have becomes a very popular presentation format, especially in the world of programming (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk).

These presentations are very short (2-3 minutes) and are extemporaneous speech acts, which means that they involved some preparation, but you don't read from a script.
In some versions of lightning talks, you use a set number of slides, and you have a time limit for each slide. For our lightning talks, you are not required to use slides but, if you use them, you should use no more than ten and include only short titles for text (no script).

## Grading

If you stand up and give a talk, you get a 100%. Because, yay for you, you did it!

## Going over time

If you go long, a gong might sound, or loud music might play. Or maybe the sound of a cat meowing. It's hard to say.

## Topics

### Tell Me Something I Don't Know

Just like it sounds. Give us the inside scoop on something cool you've discovered while learning about data-driven communication

### Failbetter (Epic Fail, What's Next)

Let's face it, we've all failed at one point. tell your story, and focus on what you learned.
(The title of this one comes from  Samuel Beckett: "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.")

### What We're Making Relates to a Big Idea

Connect a thing you're working on to a big idea, such as those found in "Who Owns the Future?"

### This is Happening, People (focuses on news)

If you have a strong sense of a current events issue you want to highlight, but perhaps no example of a visualization to go with it, pick this one and talk about your news topic.

### #beautytruth

Find a cool viz, or website, or infographic, or interactive and focus on how its design elements make it appealing or more effective. Don't forget: "form follows function."

### Using Data to Tell Stories

This one might blur with the above topic a bit, but here you'll focus on storytelling rather than design. Don't forget: "form follows function."
