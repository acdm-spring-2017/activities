# Annotation activities

- For these activities, we will use the Hypothes.is annotator to make comments that everyone else can see! 

- By now, you should all have hypothes.is accounts and be members of the acdm-spring-2017 group. You should also have the hypothes.is extension installed on Chrome

- If you aren't finished with these preliminary steps, go back to https://github.com/acdm-spring-2017/activities/blob/master/accounts.md

### Here are some genral hypothes.is instructions:  

1. Using chrome, go to the website you wish to annotate. 
2. Using your mouse, select a block of text you would like to annotate
3. A small menu will pop up where you have selected text. Click the button that says "annotate."
4. If the Hypothes.is sidebar is hidden it will expand with a new text area where you can annotate
5. Use tags to note the category of your annotations. Descriptions below will aks you to use specific tags
6. Once you've finished writing your annotation, click the button to "Post to acdm-spring-2017"

### Annotation 1: 
- For this annotation assignment, we want to focus on connecting the reading to your skills assignment
- Go to https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf 
- Make annotations on ideas or statements that pertain to your experience learning git, html, css and other skills
- In your annotation, explain how the statement is connected to your experience
- Connections can be points of similarity or difference. You can also mark ideas worth trying out and things that have changed your perspective on your itinial experiences. 
- Make at least five annotations. We will discuss them when everyone has finished. 

### Annotation 2:
- For this annotation assignment, I want to highlight two very helpful sandboxing tools that go very well together: 
stackoverflow.com and jsfiddle.net. Stackoverflow (part of stackexchange) is a discussion board where developers can go to post questions or errors, 
"a community of 6.6 million programmers, just like you, helping each other." jsfiddle is a html, css, and javascript practice area. You can set up a bit of code, run it, and see the result. 
You can also save fiddles and fork off of other people's fiddles to build on others' work. Stackoverflow and jsfiddle work hand in hand because someone will often ask a question on stack, and then
someone else will post an answer with a link to a working fiddle. 
- In other words, these sites are worth learning about! Use hypothes.is to browse around on stackoverflow.com. if you don't know what to look for, you can always browse the latest posts under html, css, or javascript. 
- Also, try Googling things like "centered div jsfiddle" to see if you can find useful prototypes. 
- If you like, sign up for stackoverflow and jsfiddle accounts
- Annotate some sites with simple comments like "wow!" or "useful" or "maybe use this for a project."  
- make sure your annotations go in acdm-spring-2017
