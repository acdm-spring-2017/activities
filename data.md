## Data Creation Activity, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017

For this activity, we're going to practice converting information from a non-data friendly format to a row-column structure. This type of work is typical in data journalism and digital humanities. In data journalism, a freedom of information request is often answered with a packet of pdf files. I've simulated this experience by providing a pdf of a bibliography of gothic novels.

### Initial Instructions

- With a partner (or in a group of 3) go to this repository: https://github.com/acdm-spring-2017/frank-gothic-data
- Fork the repo like you did with skills
- Clone the forked repo to your desktops using "git clone" command
- Find the cloned directory using the finder (mac) or explorer (pc)
- Open the pdf file called "frank_gothic_merged.pdf"

### Dividing up the File

- Each group (or pair) will get a number between 1 and 7
- Your group (or pair) be in charge of the page that matches your number
- Open a blank excel file, save it somewhere, named after your group or pair, such as "sterling-draper"
- Go through each title on your designated page of "frank_gothic_merged.pdf" and put a title from the sheet in a separate row of your spreadsheet
- use a separate column for the year

### When You Are Done Converting Data

- save the file in csv format in your repo folder
- git add, commit, and push your files to your fork
- send me a pull request as you did for the skills assignment
