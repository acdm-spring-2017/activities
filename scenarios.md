# Scenarios and Topics

Below are scenarios for the synthesis 1, synthesis 2 and team assignments. Once you have a scenario, you must choose a specific topic. Each scenario has its own rules for how to narrow it down to a topic choice. Finding or making the right data will have a lot to do with what you choose to do.

## Data autobiography (will only work for synthesis 1 or 2)

- The premise here is to turn some aspect of your own life into data. Maybe you want to focus on analyzing your writing style by turning your emails into a dataset. Or maybe you want to track everywhere you go for a week to see how and where you spend the most time. Emphasizes self-exploration, and autobiography.
- Will only work for assignments 1 and 2.
- This assignment is based on the idea of the quantified self, described in the following TED Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_wolf_the_quantified_self/transcript?language=en

## Engaging with Pittsburgh

- Choose a topic (and a dataset) that relates to Pittsburgh. How can a visualization demonstrate something new or important about the city we call home?
- Allie and Tasha's crime map is a good example of this scenario: http://publicsource.org/gun-violence-is-a-public-health-crisis-in-pittsburgh-why-hasnt-it-been-solved/

## Complicating the Commonplace

- In this scenario, you will focus on some accepted or well known "truth" and complicate or put pressure on the way we think about it.
- You might choose to focus on some topic related to public opinion or popular culture.
- A fantastic example of this kind of visualizations is David McCandless's "Horoscoped," which shows patterns of language in a year's worth of horoscope entries. http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/horoscoped/

## Out of the Past

- Pick a subject from history that can be quantified in some important way and make a data visualization that brings this aspect of history to life.
- For an amazing, ambitious example, check out the Agas Map of Early Modern London: https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/agas.htm (caution: no one expects you to make something this involved. It took the project team years to build it!)
- This scenario is best for synthesis 2 or the team based project, as it will likely require creating new data.

## From a Distance

- Distant reading is a specific set of computational practices associated with large scale literary studies but, for this scenario, you can choose any work of literature or public rhetoric that would be too big to analyze by hand
- Your analysis/visualization should make the topic you focus on more readable or lucid
For an example, check out this article by Ted Underwood and Jordan Sellers: http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-2/the-emergence-of-literary-diction-by-ted-underwood-and-jordan-sellers/
- This scenario is best for synthesis 2 or the team based project, as it will likely require creating new data.

# How to propose a scenario.

- Do a bit of preliminary research to see if you can find a good example of the kind of thing you would want to make
- Make an appointment to meet with me and discuss your idea
- Turn in, via email, a brief summary of the scenario and why it would work well for this class
